# TITANIC_SURVIVAL_PREDICTION_
TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION involves using data analysis and machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of survival for passengers aboard the Titanic. This project typically uses a dataset containing information such as passengers' age, gender, class, and other relevant factors. Machine learning models are trained on this data to identify patterns and factors that influenced survival outcomes. The goal is to create a predictive model that can accurately classify whether a given individual on the Titanic survived or not. This type of analysis is often used as a learning exercise in data science and machine learning, providing insights into feature importance and model performance while exploring the historical context of the Titanic disaster.
